Poor working conditions in the game industry have been making headlines for
years now. But so far thereâ€™s been little concrete action to actually address
widespread issues like **unpaid overtime**, **mass layoffs**, or wages that are much
lower than the rest of the tech sector. Unions are a **tried and tested** way for
workers to fight back against exploitation and abuse.

# Game workers of the world, unite!
