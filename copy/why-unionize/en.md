title: 'Why Unionize?'

# What is a union?

A union is an organization of workers dedicated to improving wages, hours, and
working conditions within their workplace or industry through collective
bargaining. **Unions leverage the collective power of workers to balance out the
power held by bosses and shareholders.**

# How do workers benefit from unions?

**Unionized workers have higher wages on average than workers who are not
unionized**, often between 15 to 25% more. Unions **also benefit workers who are
not unionized** by raising the bar for everyone. For example, a high school
graduate whose workplace is _not_ unionized but who works in an industry that’s
25% unionized overall [can still expect to be paid more than similar workers in
less unionized
industries](http://www.epi.org/publication/briefingpapers_bp143/).


Unions can also **help reduce inequality**. While **all** workers benefit from
having unions, those who benefit the most are typically the people who are the
**most disempowered or in the most precarious positions**.

# Some things unions have fought for and won in the past:

- Health care insurance
- Ending unpaid overtime
- Protection from mass layoffs
- Anti-harassment policies
- Closing the wage gap
- Paid sick leave
- Paid parental leave
- Pensions
- Week-ends

The current director of the IGDA, Jen MacLean, was CEO of 38 Studios back when
they laid off their entire staff in what was [one of the largest scandals in
game development
history](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/07/23/38-studios-end-game/). In a
[recent
interview](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/igda-director-union-crunch-interview),
MacLean defends crunch as a “choice some of us make” and toes the line with
anti-union rhetoric like _“right now we have an oversupply of people who want to
be game developers \[...\] if somebody leaves there are a hundred people lined up
to take their place.”_

**Employers will often do everything they can to discourage their employees from
unionizing**, including threatening to outsource jobs or move them overseas, or
to replace workers with more precarious and easily exploited talent. **But
that’s already happening without unions**, and it’s one way game industry bosses
have been keeping our conditions from improving until now. Unions and
international solidarity are the best way of combating these practices and their
effects on workers. **Unionizing efforts don’t have to stop at the border.**
Organizers in different countries can work together to support one another and
improve conditions for everyone. Bosses won’t be able to get around unions by
outsourcing your job if **everyone, everywhere** is unionized.

Unions have begun to appear in the game industry. The recently-founded
[STJV](https://www.stjv.fr) (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu
Vidéo) in France is already working to encourage and support unionizing efforts
in other countries. Unionized workers know that **an injury to one is an injury
to all**. Standing up for each other across borders benefits all of us in the
end. Similarly, **the STJV also represents students and unemployed game workers
as members**, as they understand that it’s by supporting them against unpaid
internships, low entry wages, and job precariousness that conditions will
improve for currently employed industry workers as well.
